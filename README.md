# Intel Product Review Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze customer reviews of Intel products from various online platforms. By leveraging advanced technologies, we can gather, preprocess, and analyze these reviews to gain valuable insights into customer sentiments, identify common themes, and enhance product development and marketing strategies.

## Features

- **Automated Data Collection**
  - Gathers reviews from platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, and tech websites using web scraping and API calls.
  
- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Cleans and organizes review data by removing HTML tags, special characters, and punctuation.
  - Converts text to lowercase and tokenizes text into words or phrases.

- **Sentiment Analysis**
  - Applies machine learning and deep learning models to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
  - Utilizes techniques like TF-IDF for feature extraction.
  - Assesses model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- **Insight Generation**
  - Identifies specific aspects of Intel products (e.g., performance, price) mentioned in reviews.
  - Analyzes sentiment associated with each aspect using aspect-based sentiment analysis.
  - Discovers common themes and topics using topic modeling (e.g., LDA).

- **Visualization**
  - Presents analysis results through visual tools such as charts, word clouds, and interactive dashboards.
  - Uses libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Tableau.

- **Continuous Improvement**
  - Establishes a feedback loop to continuously improve the sentiment analysis model based on new data and user feedback.
  - Monitors model performance and updates it with new reviews to maintain accuracy and relevance.
